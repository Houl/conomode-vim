Implements a kind of Normal mode ( "Cmdline-Normal mode" ) on top of the Command line.  Purpose is similar to the cmdline-window (q:), but navigation and editing can be done in-place.  Of course the cmdline-window is much more powerful.

- enter with c_<F4>   (press <F4> while in Command-line mode)
- mode indicator is a colon ":", moved along with the cursor, hiding the char under it
- quit to Cmdline-mode with <Esc>, o, O, ":" or any unmapped key (which then executes or inserts itself), or wait 60 seconds.

Features So Far:
- Motions: h l w b e W B E 0 ^ $ f{char} F{char} ; ,    also in Operator pending mode
- More Motions: j k
- Operators: d y c    these write to the unnamed register; c prompts for input()
- Insert: I i a A     these commands prompt for input()
- Shortcuts: yy D x X s C dd    yy -> 0y$, D -> d$, x -> dl, X -> dh, s -> cl, C -> c$, dd -> 0d$
- Simple Changes: r{char} ~
- Putting: P p      put the unnamed register
- Repeating: .      repeatable commands: d r c ~ I i a A
- Macros: q @       q starts[/stops] recording, @ executes, no register involved
- Mode Switching: <Esc> o O - back to Cmdline, <CR> - execute Cmdline
- Undo: u U         redo with "U" (to keep c_CTRL-R working); undo information survives mode switching; undo is unlimited
- Count: can be given for most commands
- Misc: <C-L> - redraw the Cmdline

Notes:
- the mode indicator may make UTF-8 characters look garbled; press Ctrl-L to redraw the Cmdline

Have fun!
